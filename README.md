Why did I move here? I guess it was the markdown. Or the... ah! I don't know. That thing, that magic. You see it on GitHub. I wanted to retire from what I was doing. You know? From that, that pain of TeX. Be a good guy for once, a family man. So, I made a markdown renderer, came here, put my feet up. Thought I'd be an engineer, like all the other engineers. My projects would be like the projects on TV. We'd fall and sit in the sun; but, well, you know how it is?
