# How to Talk to Aliens

This guide will help you identify extraterrestrial visitors, ensure mutual safety, demonstrate friendliness, ask meaningful questions, and assist them in departing Earth. It assumes you are proficient in English and understand modern reading, writing, tools, and basic arithmetic. Some steps may require specialized tools, for which you should refer to their respective guides for proper usage.

Throughout the guide, you will interact with tools, items, and entities you may not be familiar with. It is best to understand what you use, what you see, and what behaviors you notice to be well-informed throughout the process.

## Types of Aliens

A biological being or species is an alien if it originates from anywhere but the Earth. Various types of aliens may exist in our shared universe. However, we will be dealing with just a few specific types, often the ones that can be detected in the first place.

### Microbes

This is likely the universe's most common and populace type of alien. It is humanly impossible to detect the presence of alien bacterial life optically through your eyes single they are single-celled. Signs of microbial aliens can only be affirmed by specialized equipment like a microscope in a lab setting, resulting in imagery, as seen in **Figure 0.1.1A**. This guide will not document interactions with this type of alien, though other types may transmit it.

### Primitive and Complex Macro Aliens

Some aliens may feature more than a single cell and are often visible to the human eye; however, they may lack advanced evolutionary features, landing them in the “primitive” category. The simplest way to differentiate between primitive and complex aliens is to look for the density of sensors across their bodies. If you note an extrusion from their body, dense with sensors, the region likely houses the brain.

An Earthly example can be seen in **Figure 0.1.2A**, where a deer has evolved to minimize the distance between all its sensors and the brain (1). On the other hand, a starfish, as seen in **Figure 0.1.2B**, lacks any concentration of sensors. This guide assumes you are dealing with a complex creature. Still, it is acceptable to follow through even with a primitive creature, as complex creatures are likely collecting telemetry remotely.
