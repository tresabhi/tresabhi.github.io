# How to Talk to Aliens

This guide will help you identify extraterrestrial visitors, ensure mutual safety, demonstrate friendliness, ask meaningful questions, and assist them in departing Earth. It assumes you are proficient in English and understand modern reading, writing, tools, and basic arithmetic. Some steps may require specialized tools, for which you should refer to their respective guides for proper usage.

Throughout the guide, you will interact with tools, items, and entities you may not be familiar with. It is best to understand what you use, what you see, and what behaviors you notice to be well-informed throughout the process.

## Types of Aliens

A biological being or species is an alien if it originates from anywhere but the Earth. Various types of aliens may exist in our shared universe. However, we will be dealing with just a few specific types, often the ones that can be detected in the first place.

### Microbes

This is likely the universe's most common and populace type of alien. It is humanly impossible to detect the presence of alien bacterial life optically through your eyes single they are single-celled. Signs of microbial aliens can only be affirmed by specialized equipment like a microscope in a lab setting, resulting in imagery, as seen in **Figure 0.1.1A**. This guide will not document interactions with this type of alien, though other types may transmit it.

### Primitive and Complex Macro Aliens

Some aliens may feature more than a single cell and are often visible to the human eye; however, they may lack advanced evolutionary features, landing them in the “primitive” category. The simplest way to differentiate between primitive and complex aliens is to look for the density of sensors across their bodies. If you note an extrusion from their body, dense with sensors, the region likely houses the brain.

An Earthly example can be seen in **Figure 0.1.2A**, where a deer has evolved to minimize the distance between <colored blue>all its sensors and the brain (1)</colored>. On the other hand, a starfish, as seen in **Figure 0.1.2B**, lacks any concentration of sensors. This guide assumes you are dealing with a complex creature. Still, it is acceptable to follow through even with a primitive creature, as complex creatures are likely collecting telemetry remotely.

### Intelligent Aliens

It is improbable for intelligent creatures to send members of their species as the first means of exploration without inferring the intents of humanity first. Nevertheless, aliens are “intelligent” if they demonstrate their usage of technologies without any clear incentives. In other words, these aliens are well-versed with the technologies they use and are not constrained to a feedback loop, forcing them to do work. For example, Figure 0.1.3A shows a monkey using a computer. However, this does not mean it is intelligent since humans have incentivized the monkey through positive feedback: it was offered a banana to push buttons on the keyboard.

## Hazmat Suits

Safety must be at the forefront of every step when pursuing an unprecedented task. All hazmat suits are slightly different but offer the same thing: flux nulling. In other words, they drastically reduce the amount of foreign particles reaching your body. There are no guarantees of what microbes, diseases, infections, chemicals, radiation, etc., the aliens will bring along with them. The hazmat suit will be your proxy until everything is flagged safe for unprotected interaction.

Follow instructions specific to your hazmat suit to dress up; ensure you are completely sealed and shielded. Never compromise financially when purchasing suits. **Figure 0.2A** displays a generic hazmat suit comprising of the <colored blue>screen (1)</colored>, your optical interface, the <colored blue>skin (2)</colored>, the layer of fabric that minimizes foreign flux, the <colored blue>gloves (3)</colored>, serving an identical purpose to the <colored blue>skin (2)</colored> all the while allowing for physical interactions, and the <colored blue>boots (4)</colored>, increasing your surface area over soft terrain and stopping prograde fumes.

## Geiger Counters

Another bodily risk aliens pose is radiation. As seen in **Figure 0.3A**, a Geiger counter measures the radiation received divided by time and is usually displayed to the user on a <colored blue>segmented display (1)</colored>.

For the radiation, this guide uses “microrem per hour,” often denoted as “microrem/h,” “microrem/hr,” “µrem/h,” or “µrem/hr.” Consult the instructions for your specific Geiger counter to switch to using these units. Alternatively, convert your readings to hourly microrems using tools like [WolframAlpha](https://www.wolframalpha.com/).

## Sandbags

You may use sandbags to form a barrier between <colored blue>your property (3)</colored> and the aliens. As demonstrated in **Figure 0.4A**, <colored blue>sandbags (2)</colored> are very cheap and offer decent protection against <colored blue>radiation and lights (1)</colored>, the aliens may be emitting <colored>liquids (1)</colored> the biological processes may be producing, among many things. If you decide to deploy sandbags, consider building walls multiple layers thick to increase effectiveness.

## Solvents

A solvent is a substance that dissolves other things, like how water dissolves sugar or salt. It is like a universal mixing agent that helps break things down so they can spread out evenly. Water is the most common solvent, but others will be discussed later. Species of all types utilize solvents, making for some good extraterrestrial gifts.

## Modes of Propulsion

Humanity has relatively primitive propulsion modes, and advanced aliens will likely stray from conventional methods for propulsion known to humanity. All types of propulsion require different clearings and resources, which you can assist the alien with.

### Chemical Propulsion

The simplest form of propulsion combines a fuel (usually kerosene in jet engines and petrol in cars) with an oxidizer (always oxygen on Earth) to expand matter and propel the craft. Interstellar travel is slow and inefficient with this method; thus, aliens will unlikely use it.

### Nuclear Thermal Rockets

Outlawed by most countries due to the risk of nuclear contamination in case of failure, Nuclear Thermal Rockets (NTRs) excel as long-term propulsion engines. While their thrust output is generally lower than that of chemical rockets, they offer higher efficiency and greater thrust-to-mass ratios. Aliens with technology not far beyond human capabilities may favor this propulsion method, especially if they are naturally radiation-hardened due to their home world's conditions, making nuclear fallout a negligible threat to them.

### Alcubierre Drives

Scientific details are limited, but post-Einstein physics suggests faster-than-light travel might be possible by contracting space ahead and expanding it behind. This concept, the Alcubierre Drive, theoretically creates a region of negative energy density. Though its feasibility remains unknown, you must not rule out its presence on the alien spacecraft.

## Identifying Alien Life

Before proceeding with communications, you must eliminate any possibility that the observed species originates from Earth. Use the following filters to be sure beyond a reasonable doubt that you are interfacing with alien life.

### Intoxicated Hallucinations

According to the Cleveland Clinic, hallucinations due to alcohol consumption typically occur at a BAC level of 0.2-0.3% or higher. If you fall under this categorization, your impairment may lead to the misidentification of Earthly creatures. Even at levels lower than that, obscured vision can cause misidentifications, especially of <colored blue>members of your species (1)</colored>, as can be seen in **Figure 1.1A**.

Refer to [the Cleveland Clinic’s article on this topic](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diagnostics/22689-blood-alcohol-content-bac) to determine if you are hallucinating. Suspend any further steps if you are intoxicated. Some common beverages that can contribute to intoxication include:

- Beer (5% ABV): Roughly 4-5 standard 12 oz cans/bottles containing 0.6 oz of pure alcohol.
- Wine (12-15% ABV): Around 4-5 glasses, 5 oz per glass.
- Spirits (40% ABV, like whiskey, vodka, rum): About 4-5 shots, 1.5 oz per shot.
